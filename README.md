## Problem Statement

Airbnb Inc. operates an online platform for hospitality services, connecting hosts with guests seeking accommodations. This project seeks to extract valuable insights from Airbnb data to aid stakeholders in decision-making within the travel industry, property management, and tourism sectors.

## Approach

1. **MongoDB Connection and Data Retrieval**: Establish a connection to the MongoDB Atlas database and retrieve the Airbnb dataset. Perform queries and data retrieval operations to extract the necessary information for analysis.

2. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Clean the Airbnb dataset by handling missing values, duplicates, and transforming data types. Prepare the dataset for EDA and visualization tasks, ensuring data integrity and consistency.

3. **Price Analysis and Visualization**: Analyze and visualize price variations across locations, property types, and seasons using dynamic plots and charts.

4. **Availability Analysis by Season**: Investigate availability patterns, occupancy rates, and demand fluctuations throughout the year using suitable visualizations.

5. **Location-Based Insights**: Extract and visualize data for specific regions or neighborhoods to understand pricing dynamics and market trends.

6. **Geospatial Visualization**: Develop a Streamlit web application with interactive maps showcasing the distribution of Airbnb listings. Visualize prices, ratings, and other relevant factors.

7. **Interactive Visualizations**: Create dynamic and interactive visualizations that allow users to filter and explore the data based on their preferences.

8. **Dashboard Creation**: Build a comprehensive dashboard using Power BI or Tableau, combining various visualizations to present key insights from the analysis.
